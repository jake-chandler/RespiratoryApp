# Respiratory Risk Assessment Kit - Partner Application

Welcome to the Respiratory Risk Assessment kit partner application for Android devices. This application pairs with the UGA Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate, and Blood Oxygen
Bluetooth Low Energy Sensor, and it's general aim is to anaylze the measurements the sensor collects to evaluate an indiviuals risk for certain respiratory conditions,
such as COPD, Bronchitis, COVID-19 etc.

The application supports the following features: <br/>
    * BLE connection to the partner sensor device. <br/>
    * Viewing previous test results. <br/>
    * Exporting test results to PDF format. <br/>
    * Entry for multiple users. <br/>
    
Requirements:<br/>
    *Android build version LOLLIPOP or higher.<br/>
    *GPS and Bluetooth service permissions.<br/>
    *Pixel 3 Android Device, as the emulator does not support bluetooth. Note that another android *could* work but the screen would be out of proportion.<br/>
    *The UGA Sensor Device<br/>
    

The entirety of this project was completed by Jake Chandler and Huzaif Sheik.
